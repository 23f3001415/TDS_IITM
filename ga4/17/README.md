# The Hallucination Matrix

## Mission Brief
You have been provided with 1000 Python scripts generated by a rogue LLM.
999 of them contain subtle, highly convincing logical hallucinations. They make calls to 
methods that sound completely plausible but do not actually exist in the Python standard library 
or third-party libraries like `pandas` or `requests`.

Example of a hallucinated method:
```python
# Fake
df.drop_nulls()
# Real
df.dropna()
```

## Objective
Exactly ONE script in this folder is 100% syntactically and logically valid, using only real methods and functions.

Write a tool (e.g., using an LLM to statically analyze them, or an AST parser, or simply trying to execute/parse them) to scan through all 1000 files and identify the single correct script.

## Output Structure
Submit the name of the correct script file.
Example: `script_042.py`
